# Patrick-Hennessey-personal-blog

## Description
A two-page website where users can input and view blog posts. The website includes a content form, dynamically rendered blog posts, and a consistent light-dark mode between pages using local storage. The motivation for this project was to develop a website I can use for my personal blog posts concerning computer science, literature, philosophy, and art. Using JavaScript, I built a dynamic website that saves blog posts in the local storage, allowing me to return to them whenever needed. This was a challenging project, but it was a great learning experience. I learned mainly about JavaScript and the DOM model and how to use logic and computation to display blog posts correctly.
Additionally, I learned about local storage and how to keep dynamic consistency between my web pages. Also solidified my knowledge of CSS, especially concerning selectors. The most problematic feature to implement was the light and dark toggle button. It was incredibly challenging to save the light or dark mode functionality to local storage to stay consistent between pages. After many hours and frustration, I figured it out, however. I learned several javascript features not covered in the boot camp, such as tertiary operators, forEach loops, and window.onload, how to us || operator when declaring variables that may or may not exist perviously in the code. The project still has a lot of work to do, especially with the CSS and cleaning up the code so it is cleaner and more concise.
